"""
1a. Create an ssh_conn function. This function should have three parameters: ip_addr, username, and password. The function should print out each of these three variables and clearly indicate which variable it is printing out.

Call this ssh_conn function using entirely positional arguments.

Call this ssh_conn function using entirely named arguments.

Call this ssh_conn function using a mix of positional and named arguments.


1b. Expand on the ssh_conn function from exercise1 except add a fourth parameter 'device_type' with a default value of 'cisco_ios'. Print all four of the function variables out as part of the function's execution.

Call the 'ssh_conn2' function both with and without specifying the device_type

Create a dictionary that maps to the function's parameters. Call this ssh_conn2 function using the **kwargs technique.
