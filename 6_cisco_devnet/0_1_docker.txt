#Dockerfile example
FROM ubuntu



# What we're doing here is building an image using a Dockerfile in the current directory (.) and giving a name, or "tag", of myubuntu.
docker build -t myubuntu
docker run -it myubuntu /bin/sh
ls -al



# Example Python environment with docker
# ... invokes a Debian Linux-based default image from Docker Hub, 
# with the latest version of Python installed. 
# Let's assume your app is saved as sample-app.py. 
# We can then tell Docker to create the /home/ubuntu directory and copy sample-app.py to the container:

FROM python
WORKDIR /home/ubuntu
COPY ./sample-app.py /home/ubuntu/.
RUN pip install flask
CMD python /home/ubuntu/sample-app.py
EXPOSE 8080

# Now that weâ€™ve defined what we want our image to be, we need to go ahead and build it:
sudo docker build -t sample-app-image .
