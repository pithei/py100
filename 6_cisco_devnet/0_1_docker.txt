#Dockerfile example

# Example Python environment with docker
# ... invokes a Debian Linux-based default image from Docker Hub, 
# with the latest version of Python installed. 
# Let's assume your app is saved as sample-app.py. 
# We can then tell Docker to create the /home/ubuntu directory and copy sample-app.py to the container:

FROM python
WORKDIR /home/ubuntu
COPY ./sample-app.py /home/ubuntu/.
RUN pip install flask
CMD python /home/ubuntu/sample-app.py
